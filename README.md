<h1>ðŸ©º Detection and Comparison of Algorithms for Pneumonia Prediction</h1>
<p>
  This project focuses on building and evaluating deep learning models to predict pneumonia from chest X-ray images. 
  Leveraging powerful convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it compares the performance of multiple state-of-the-art 
  architectures including <strong>ResNet</strong>, <strong>VGG</strong>, <strong>Inception</strong>, and 
  <strong>Xception</strong>. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for pneumonia detection.
